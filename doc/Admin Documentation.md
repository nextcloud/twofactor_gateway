### Signal
URL: https://www.signal.org/
Stability: Experimental

This gateways allows you to send messages via the Signal protocol. By
default it tries to use the native HTTP endpoint of
[signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) which is available
since [signal-cli 0.11.5](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0115---2022-11-07).

If the native HTTP endpoint of signal-cli is not available then it
tries to use the REST service provided by either
[stand-alone Python signal-cli REST API](https://morph027.gitlab.io/python-signal-cli-rest-api)
or
[Docker signal-cli REST API](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api)

*Note: Signal users are bound to phone numbers. If you already use Signal on your phone, you
need a separate number for the gateway's registration.*

Once you've set up the gateway, you can configure this app interactively:

```bash
occ twofactorauth:gateway:configure signal
```

You need to speficy the URL where the API provider is listening and
the Signal-account of the sending Signal user.

### Telegram
URL: https://www.telegram.org/
Stability: Unstable

This gateways allows you to send messages via the Telegram protocol. In order to send messages,
you have to register a [Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots), which is used to send
authentication codes to users after they have initiated a conversation and entered their
Telegram ID.

Follow these steps to activate the Telegram authentication gateway:

1. Register a Telegram Bot.

   * Open your Telegram client, search for `@BotFather` and start a conversation.
   * Send `/newbot` to start the bot setup process.
   * Send the name of the bot, e.g. `'My own NC bot'`.
   * Send the username of the bot, e.g. `'my_nc_bot'`.

   BotFather confirms that a new bot has successfully been set-up and provides the HTTP API
   access token to you, e.g. `'123456789:AAbbCCddEEffGGhhIIjjKKllMMnnOOppQQ'`.

2. Activate the Nextcloud Twofactor Gateway for Telegram
   Open a command shell on your Nextcloud server, navigate to the Nextcloud directory and run
   the following command:
   ```bash
   occ twofactorauth:gateway:configure telegram
   Please enter your Telegram bot token: 123456789:AAbbCCddEEffGGhhIIjjKKllMMnnOOppQQ
   Using 123456789:AAbbCCddEEffGGhhIIjjKKllMMnnOOppQQ.
   ```

   The Telegram authentication gateway has now successfully been set-up. Follow the instructions
   in the [User Documentation] to activate the Gateway for a specific user.
