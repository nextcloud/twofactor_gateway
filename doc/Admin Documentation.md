   * Send the name of the bot, e.g. `'My own NC bot'`.
   * Send the username of the bot, e.g. `'my_nc_bot'`.

   BotFather confirms that a new bot has successfully been set-up and provides the HTTP API
   access token to you, e.g. `'123456789:AAbbCCddEEffGGhhIIjjKKllMMnnOOppQQ'`.

2. Activate the Nextcloud Twofactor Gateway for Telegram

   the following command:
